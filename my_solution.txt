This is my flow of operations for this exercise for better understanding of my decisions and internal process

1. BASICS 
I have created folder inside which I put CSV file and my python file. 
mock_transactions_final.CSV
analysis.py

2. DOCS and STARTING OUT 
Since I needed to refresh my Python skills, I watched 2 tutorial videos on this matter which took me about 10 minutes (2x speed). 
To get back up to speed on essential tools required for this task — namely Python and Pandas. 
I also used ChatGPT to assist me with crafting code, particularly for rearranging data. 
Throughout the code, I’ve left my own comments as well as some suggestions from ChatGPT that I decided to keep for clarity and better understanding. 
I want to be transparent about the resources I used and the approach I took.
- those are resources I used or looked at through my working on this project:

3. RUNNING SCRIPT
- upon running and refining the script I got final output in terminal: 

matus@LAPTOP-33US5PB5 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/ZigExercise
$ python analysis.py 

Account: ZignalyX120
Up to: 2025-01-30 08:42:00

Totals by Transaction Type:
 - deposit: +7127.00 
 - fee: -3065.92 
 - loss: -273.46 
 - profit: +2473.84 
 - withdrawal: -1467.28 

Final Balance: 4794.18 

4. TRANSACTION CORRELATION 
I have created second python script with help of chatgpt and my refining. 
- this script shows in terminal all the transactions until specified Timestamp
- at the end can be seen weather the transaction was positive or negative from the specified account 

matus@LAPTOP-33US5PB5 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/ZigExercise
$ python transaction_flow.py

All transactions affecting ZignalyX120 up to 2025-01-30 08:42:00:

Final Balance: 4794.18

5. FINAL FILE 
I have used this video for google sheets for better understanding of google cloud and google sheets since I did not work with it before this exercise in any practical manner 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCEJurLGFRk&ab_channel=TechWithTim
I spent quite time troubleshooting errors in google sheets json format conversion to show right in final output 
below is also terminal successfull terminal output which is from combined_analysis.py
- combined_analysis.py combines transaction_flow.py and analysis.py and I also added google sheets API with creation of report 
- report can be accessed at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/179UXu4f83bNfAAM0xEQ1n4g_qRlGx9OSCl1AOzko0jw/edit?gid=0#gid=0
(the file name combined_analysis2.py was named like that because this was second refined version of combined_analysis file and I did not want to lose previous one until this one worked)
